# Markov Chain Monte Carlo : Theory and applications Course

This course was taught by R. Douc and S. Le Corff

The pratical work consisted in working on an article through an analysis, discussion and implementation. The project was done within a group of four students. 

This repository contains the original paper studied, [*Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms with sequential proposals*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.06544) written by Joonha Park and Yves F. Atchad√©. The paper is provided in a pdf format. 

The work done by the group was handed out as a Jupyter notebook. It develops the main theoretical concepts developed in the article and showcases an implementation of the proposed algorithms and models.
