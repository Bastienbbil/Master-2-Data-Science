# Deep Learning I Course

This course was taught by G. Peeters and A. Newson (Telecom ParisTech)

The pratical work consisted in 3 labs respectively :

* The first Lab was dedicatd to Multi-Layer Percceptron and consists in two notebooks : one implementing all the steps using numpy (loss definition, forward and backward propagation, gradient descent, training and evaluating) to fully understand them, the second one implements the same network using pytorch

* The second Lab was dedicated to Recurrent Neural Networks and consists in two notebooks : one implementing a Many-to-One architecture for movie rating prediction (using keras and the imdb datbase) while the second one implements a Many-to-Many language model and a One-to-Many generating model using keras as well. 

* The third Lab was dedicated to Convolutional Neural Network and consists, once more in two notebooks : the first one implements an image classification model using keras and the second one explores the Deep Dream algorithm and adversarial examples (also with keras)
