As part of the Data Camp course, within the Data Science Master at Institut Polytechnique de Paris, students were required to build a data challenge addressing some social/science/business problem using data obtained from external sources. This is one example of a student challenge, showcased on the ramp.studio server.

# Predicting the engagement rate on Instagram

Instagram offers to brands through the intermediairy of influencers, a direct digital promotion and visibility channel. Indeed, the proximity that influencers develop daily with their community offers a relatively wide audience but more importantly it enables brands to develop a more engaging communication than traditional campaigns or than direct digital campaigns using Instagram ads/brand accounts. This project aims at predicting the engagement rate per post. In order to get this prediction, candidate will have access to the top 50 influencers'posts that we scrapped from Instagram.
