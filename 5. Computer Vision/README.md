# Computer Vision Course

This course was taught by A. Newson (Telecom ParisTech)

The pratical work consisted in two labs that you can find in this repository :

* The first Lab (TP1) consists in three notebooks with work on respectively filtering, radiometry and restoration 

* The second Lab (TP2) consists in three notebooks with work on respectively segmentation, feature detection and motion estimation

These Labs were an implementation in Python of the basic concepts of Computer Vision seen in class.
